# Points-and-Rectangles-Collision-Detection-in-Java
Point-to-point and rectangle-to-rectangle collision algorithms.

Note: The algorithms for rectangle-to-rectangle collision that are explained here only work with axis-aligned rectangles. In other words, They only work with rectangles that are not rotated.

This project requires viewers to have an understanding of Java basic GUI concepts because this project mostly focuses on explaining collision algorithms.

This project explains how to detect a collision between points, rectangles and both. For rectangle collision, this project will show the Java built-in collision detection for rectangle collisions before discussing the AABB(Axis Aligned Bounding Box) algorithm.

The 'Complete' directory contains UI codes and collision algorithms. The 'Setup' directory contains UI codes only. Use the files in 'Complete' folder for your reference and use files in 'Setup' folder if you wanna follow my tutorial that I mentioned above.
